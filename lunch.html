        <b id="desc3">What Is Mutton? In essence, mutton is a mature sheep, meaning it's between the ages of 1 and 3. The animal gets butchered the same way a cow or lamb is, so mutton chops, steaks, bacon, belly, and other sections are available. The meat tends to have more of a gamey flavor than lamb, but most of the time it's not much stronger. calories:15,000</b>
